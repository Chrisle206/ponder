## Description

Ever wanted to make a Twitter post, but anonymously? Ever wanted to say something without fear of getting canceled? Ever just felt like jumping into a spicy conversation with a stranger, with no strings attached? Then we have the app for you.

Ponder is a randomized social forum, whereby the user is able to 'Go Fish' from a pool of thoughts collected from all around the world, or post a thought themselves. The user has the option to create an account and post their thoughts, or 'Ponders,' under their username, but they can also elect to post anonymously. No account is necessary to use Ponder--anyone can join the conversation. However, only users with an account will be able to see a history of all their posts, and users posting anonymously will have a profanity filter applied to help curb toxicity.

The user can post their Ponders under a specific category, or 'No Category' if preferred. There are no restrictions on what the user can post, as long as they are logged in. Similarly, the user can 'Go Fish' from a specific category and draw a random thread therefrom, or elect to draw a completely random thread with no category specified.

There is a 'Recent Ponders' aside that renders beneath the main form, which will showcase a feed of all of the most recent Ponders that have been posted to the site. Users can click on these posts to be brought to their respective threads, wherein they can interact with the post by commenting, upvoting, and downvoting. Posts that have particularly high amounts of upvotes and downvotes will be featured on our 'Popular Ponders'! Aim to write a post that tops the list!

Lastly, you can click on any user to view a history of their posts. You will need an account of your own, however, in order to see a history of your own posts. So join Ponder today!

Ponder is a fully developed fullstack application, sporting a sleek and intuitive front-end design and an equally robust back-end database and server. It was developed in just one week under the skilled hands of our development team, credited below, for our coding bootcamp's second dedicated project session. This was our first time working on a project with a dedicated backend, built from the ground up, and we have learned a lot about all aspects of fullstack development in the process. We hope you enjoy using Ponder as much as we've enjoyed and grown from creating it!

## Installation

Ponder requires no installation to use as it is a web-based application. You can access it here at:
(url placeholder)

## Usage

Ponder is easy to use! To begin, decide whether you want to 'Go Fish' for a random thread, or post your very own Ponder. If you just want to read someone else's Ponder, or feel like jumping into a conversation (or lurking), simply click the 'Go Fish' button (choose a category if desired). A Ponder will instantly render to the page, and you can interact with the post therefrom via upvote/downvote/comment. You do not have to be logged in to access any of these features.

If you would like to post your own Ponder, it's as simple as typing your thought/idea/conversation starter into the text field on the main page, selecting a category from the dropdown underneath, selecting whether you want to post anonymously or not (this selection makes no difference to users who are not logged in), and then pressing the 'Cast' button to cast your thoughts into the Pond!
